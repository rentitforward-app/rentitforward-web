- [ ] Handle geocoding errors and fallbacks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Shared Utilities Foundation
1. **Geolocation Utilities**: Create core functions for location handling, distance calculations, and coordinate conversions
2. **Geocoding Service**: Integrate external geocoding API with error handling and caching
3. **Database Helpers**: Create Supabase query helpers for location-based operations

### Phase 2: Database and Backend
1. **Database Migration**: Ensure all existing listings have proper geographic coordinates
2. **API Routes**: Create geocoding endpoints for both web and mobile
3. **Spatial Indexing**: Optimize database for location-based queries

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
1. **Web Browse Page**: Implement real distance sorting and location-based filtering
2. **Mobile Create Screen**: Add geocoding to listing creation process
3. **Map Integration**: Replace placeholder MapView with real map functionality

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. **Location Permissions**: Proper handling of user location permissions
2. **Address Autocomplete**: Improve UX for location input
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and efficient location queries

## Technical Requirements

### Geocoding Service Options
- **Google Maps Geocoding API**: Most accurate but has usage costs
- **MapBox Geocoding API**: Good alternative with generous free tier
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim**: Free but may have limitations

### Distance Calculation Methods
- **Haversine Formula**: Great circle distance calculation for Earth
- **PostGIS ST_Distance**: Database-level distance calculation
- **Hybrid Approach**: Client-side for sorting, server-side for search

### Location Data Structure
```typescript
interface Location {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  address: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postal_code: string;
  country: string;
}

interface ListingWithDistance extends Listing {
  distance?: number; // in kilometers
  userLocation?: Location;
}
```
