4. Payment Flow

-	The platform holds the payment in escrow.
-	Payment is released to the owner after the rental period is complete (minus the platform’s commission).
-	Deposits are held in escrow and refunded within 2-3 business days after the rental is returned in good condition.

5. Deposit Handling

-	Security Deposit Recommendation Guide 
Item Value (AUD)	Suggested Deposit Range	Platform Tip
Under $100	No deposit recommended	Trust-based rental; low-value risk.
$100 – $500	$50 – $100	Enough to deter mishandling without deterring renters.
$500+	$100 – $300	Higher deposit ensures accountability and covers potential repair costs.

-	Deposits are refunded if the item is returned undamaged within the specified return period. Deposits are held in escrow. At the end of the rental, both the sharer (owner) and the renter must confirm via the app that: 
- The rental is completed, and 
- The item has been returned in good condition. 
Once both confirmations are received, the platform will release the deposit back to the renter. Refunds are processed within 2–3 business days of receiving the confirmations.
-	Partial Deductions: If the item is returned with damage, the deposit may be partially or fully withheld to cover repair or replacement costs, depending on the extent of the damage.
o	Example: If a camera is returned with a broken lens, a portion of the deposit may be used to repair the damage.
