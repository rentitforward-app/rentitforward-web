#### 4. **Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- New payment statuses
'paid_awaiting_release', 'released_to_owner'

-- New tracking fields
stripe_payment_intent_id VARCHAR(255)
stripe_transfer_id VARCHAR(255)
admin_released_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
admin_released_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

#### 5. **New Pricing Utilities**

## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE**

### **Step 1: Configure Stripe Connect**

1. **Get Stripe Keys**:
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   ```

2. **Enable Stripe Connect**:
   - Dashboard → Connect → Settings
   - Enable "Express accounts"
   - Set platform name: "Rent It Forward"

3. **Create Webhook**:
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/payments/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: `account.updated`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `transfer.created`, `payout.paid`

### **Step 2: Test the Implementation**

1. **Test Admin Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit: http://localhost:3000/admin/payment-releases
   ```

2. **Test Pricing Calculations**:
   ```bash
   # Visit: http://localhost:3000/test-pricing
   ```

3. **End-to-End Booking Test**:
   - Create a new booking with insurance
   - Process payment (it will be held in escrow)
   - Owner confirms return
   - Admin releases payment after 2 working days

### **Step 3: Update Existing Components**

1. **Update Booking Components** to use new pricing:
   ```typescript
   import { calculateBookingPricing } from '@/lib/pricing';
   
   const pricing = calculateBookingPricing({
     dailyRate: listing.price_per_day,
     numberOfDays: daysDifference,
     includeInsurance: insuranceSelected,
     securityDeposit: listing.deposit || 0
   });
   ```

2. **Update Payment Forms** to show correct breakdown
3. **Update Admin Navigation** to include payment releases

## 📊 **BUSINESS LOGIC VERIFICATION**

### **Example Pricing Calculation**:
```
Bike Rental: $30/day × 2 days = $60

RENTER PAYS:
- Base Price: $60.00
- Service Fee (15%): $9.00  
- Insurance (10%): $6.00
- Security Deposit: $50.00
TOTAL: $125.00

OWNER RECEIVES:
- Base Price: $60.00
- Platform Commission (20%): -$12.00
PAYOUT: $48.00
```

### **Payment Release Process**:
1. Renter pays → Funds held in Stripe escrow
2. Rental completes → Owner confirms return
3. After 2 working days → Admin can release payment
4. Admin releases → Stripe transfers to owner's account
