# Complete Booking Flow Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview
Implement a complete rental booking flow from item browsing to payment release, integrated with Stripe Connect for secure payments and escrow functionality.

## 🎯 Business Requirements

### Pricing Structure
- **Renter pays**: Base price + 15% service fee + optional add-ons (insurance 10%, deposit)
- **Owner receives**: Base price - 20% platform commission
- **Example**: $30/day bike → Renter pays $47.50 (with insurance), Owner gets $24

### Payment Components
- Base rental price (set by owner)
- Platform service fee: 15% (added to renter's total)
- Platform commission: 20% (deducted from owner's payout)
- Insurance: 10% of daily rate

### Example Calculation Update Needed
```
Base Price: $30/day for 2 days = $60
Service Fee: $60 × 15% = $9
Insurance: $30 × 10% × 2 days = $6
Deposit: $50 (optional)
RENTER PAYS: $60 + $9 + $6 + $50 = $125

Platform Commission: $60 × 20% = $12
OWNER RECEIVES: $60 - $12 = $48
```
